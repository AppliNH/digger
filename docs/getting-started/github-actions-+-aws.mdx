title: "Github Actions + AWS"
description: "In this tutorial we will be using a repository in order to configure a terraform pipeline [https://github.com/diggerhq/digger\_demo\_multienv](https://github.com/diggerhq/digger%5Fdemo%5Fmultienv)."
---

In this tutorial, you will set up Digger to automate terraform pull requests using Github Actions and AWS 

#Prerequisites
- A GitHub repository with valid terraform code. Here's a [demo repo](https://github.com/diggerhq/quickstart-actions-aws)
- Your AWS credentials. See [Hashicorp's AWS tutorual](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/aws-build)

# Create digger.yml
This file contains Digger configuration and needs to be placed at the root level of your repository. Assuming your terraform code is in the `prod` directory:
```
projects:
- name: production
  dir: prod
```


# Add your AWS credentials to Action Secrets
Note: This is relevant if utilizing basic credentials. If you are using OIDC please refer to [the relevant documentation](https://docs.digger.dev/cloud-providers/authenticating-with-oidc-on-aws)
- Go to Secrets and Variables - Actions
- Click New Repository Secret
- Name it `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- Paste the your AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
- Create another New Repository Secret
- Name it `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- Paste in your `Secret access key`

# Create Github Actions workflow file
Place it at `.github/workflows/digger-tf.yml`

```
name: Digger Plan

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]
    types: [ opened, synchronize ]
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]
  workflow_dispatch:


jobs:
  plan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:    
      contents: write      # required to merge PRs
      id-token: write      # required for workload-identity-federation
      pull-requests: write # required to post PR comments
      statuses: write      # required to validate combined PR status

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      # Unlike GCP; the role assumption is handled inline 
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: digger run
        uses: diggerhq/digger@v0.2.0
        with:
          setup-aws: true
          #Uncomment below line if using OIDC
          #aws-role-to-assume: arn:aws:sts::{secrets.AccountID}:assumed-role/{secrets.RoleName}/{FunctionName}
         
          #Comment the following two lines out if using OIDC. 
          aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          ##End comment block
          aws-region: us-east-1
        env:
          GITHUB_CONTEXT: ${{ toJson(github) }}
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
         
```

This file defines a simple workflow that
- Checks out repository using Github's official [Checkout action](https://github.com/actions/checkout)
- Runs Digger against a the given AWS account. 

# AWS locks for Digger 
Digger  in AWS uses DynamoDB to handle locks. The [demo repo](https://github.com/diggerhq/quickstart-actions-aws) contains example terraform code to spin up the  relevant DynamoDB resources. 

# Create a PR to verify that it works

Terraform  will run an existing plan against your code. 

Make any change to your terraform code e.g. add a blank line. An action run should start (you can see log output in Actions). After some time you should see output of Terraform Plan added as a comment to your PR. 

Then you can add a comment like `digger apply` and shortly after apply output will be added as comment too.
